---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even with control plane components running as static pods, master hosts still source their configuration from 
the /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manifests for these static pods are installed by default by the openshift-ansible installer, 
located in the /etc/origin/node/pods directory on the master host.

These pods have the following hostPath volumes defined:

/etc/origin/master	
Contains all certificates, configuration files, and the admin.kubeconfig file.

/var/lib/origin	
Contains volumes and potential core dumps of the binary.

/etc/origin/cloudprovider	
Contains cloud provider specific configuration (AWS, Azure, etc.).

/usr/libexec/kubernetes/kubelet-plugins	
Contains additional third party volume plug-ins.

/etc/origin/kubelet-plugins	
Contains additional third party volume plug-ins for system containers.
